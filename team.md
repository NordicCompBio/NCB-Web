## Marcel Tarbier
**Project Member**  
Sweden  
I am a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institute and SciLifeLab in Stockholm. My research focuses on quantitative aspects of single-cell biology, omics technologies and data integration to answer fundamental biological questions with regard to gene regulation and chromatin architecture. I am convinced that Nordic CompBio can address the need for computational biologists to exchange ideas past institutional and country borders.
