        **Sweden**<br>
        I am a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institute and SciLifeLab in Stockholm. My research focuses on quantitative aspects of single-cell biology, omics technologies and data integration to answer fundamental biological questions with regard to gene regulation and chromatin architecture. I am convinced that Nordic CompBio can address the need for computational biologists to exchange ideas past institutional and country borders."

      - name: "Johan Österlund"
        role: "Project member<br>
        **Sweden**<br>
        My primary interest lies in systems biology and multiomic data integration. I am particularly fascinated by the visualization techniques and the theory behind combining information of different scale, encoding and biological setting. Nordic Computational Biology provides a natural place for me and others to socialize, learn and develop together. The project is open for anyone with a burning interest in computational biology and related fields, a society that is actively non-exclusive which I find extremely valuable."

        role: "Project member<br>
        **Finland**<br>
        I am a PhD student in the field of Systems Biology with interests in Immunology, transcriptomics and single-cell technologies.  I appreciate the gesture from the Nordic Computational Biology to welcome, develop and integrate researchers across the nordics and other countries with a light collaborative dynamic."

        role: "Project member<br>
        **Sweden**<br>
        My interest is mainly immunoinformatics, currently working with B-cell receptor sequences, but in general, I'm interested in systems biology (also its relationship with biostatistics and mathematical modelling), bioinformatics and NGS. I believe that the Nordic CompBio is an excellent opportunity to learn from different people about the field that unites us all as professionals. It also makes possible the visualization and sharing of information and research, which in turn promotes the development of more scientists, generating a positive impact on the scientific world."
